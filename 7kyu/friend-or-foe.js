// Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

// If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

// Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", k"Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

// i.e.

// friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]
// Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

function friend(friends){
    let filtered = friends.filter(friend => friend.length == 4)
    return filtered
  }
  function friend(friends){
    let filtered = friends.filter(friend => friend.length == 4)
    return filtered
  }
